          <h2>Patriot Saint of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Swami Vivekananda</b> (1863-1902) was a prominent Indian Hindu
            monk and a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of
            Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. Born as Narendranath Datta in
            Kolkata, India, he became a disciple of the mystic Ramakrishna
            Paramahamsa. Vivekananda is best known for his speech at the
            Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, where he
            began with the words "Sisters and brothers of America..." and
            received a standing ovation for his message of religious tolerance
            and universal acceptance. He emphasized the importance of
            selflessness, the unity of all religions, and the potential divinity
            within every human being. He founded the Ramakrishna Mission and the
            Ramakrishna Math, which focus on spiritual teachings, education, and
            social reform. His teachings continue to inspire millions around the
            world.
